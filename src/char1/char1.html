                        Bob works maintenance for municipal sensor grids in one of the first fully automated smart cities.
                        His job consists of ensuring traffic flow, climate control systems, and public safety drones don’t break down.
                        Most days, he runs diagnostics, patch firmware, and file reports that nobody reads.

                    Bob grew up during a period of rapid automation, when artificial intelligence systems quietly replaced large
                    segments of the workforce across sectors like transportation, logistics, and customer service.
                    His parents were employed in regional supply chain operations and were among the last to
                    be displaced by autonomous delivery networks.

                            Most relationships are polite but distant — hard to connect when everything’s
                            mediated through screens.

                            Keeps in touch with a younger cousin who works in digital policy advocacy,
                            though they often disagree on how much good the system can actually do.

                            Most other interactions are casual—acquaintances from work, neighbors he nods to but don’t really know.
