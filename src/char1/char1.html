                        Bob works maintenance for sensor grids in one of the first fully automated smart cities.
                        His job consists of ensuring traffic flow, climate control systems, and public safety drones don’t break down.
                        Most days, he runs diagnostics, patch firmware, and file reports that nobody reads.

                    Bob grew up during a period of rapid automation, when artificial intelligence systems quietly replaced large
                    segments of the workforce across sectors like transportation, logistics, and customer service.
                    His parents were employed in regional supply chain operations and were among the last to
                    be displaced by autonomous delivery networks.

                            arranged through screens.

                            Most other interactions are casual—acquaintances from work, neighbors he nods to but don’t really interact.
