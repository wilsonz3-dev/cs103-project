                <p>
                    Once a mid-sized shipping town, now known as a testing center for new artificial intelligence products.
                    The town's economy revolves around maintaining automated supply lines, managing data centers,
                    and supporting tech contracted by federal and corporate agencies.

                    <p>
                    Bayridge’s population sits just under 100,000. It skews older, with many residents choosing to stay despite better opportunities
                    in metropolitan cores. The younger crowd tend to work in tech-adjacent maintenance
                    roles, or provide support services for the few industries that haven’t gone completely virtual.

                    <p>
                    Bayridge is modest, functional, and just a bit worn at the edges. Public transit is AI-run
                    and sparsely used. Most buildings are retrofitted with climate-stabilizing panels,
                    and even the old brick libraries now host charging stations and telepresence booths.

                    delivery drones remain compliant with federal safety regulations.

                    The town is situated along a coastal area once dominated by large-scale wind farms,
                    many of which are now outdated and barely operational. The few remaining green spaces are genetically
                    engineered to endure both fluctuating temperatures and extreme weather,
                    ensuring that the town can survive even in a shifting climate.
