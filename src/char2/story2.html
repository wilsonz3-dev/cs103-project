        <h1> Ray Cove</h1>
        <p> Named after the Manta Rays that live in its waters, a seaside town inhabited by waterfolk. </p>
    <div id="cove">
        <div id="popu">
            <h3> Population </h3>
            <p> Think of this as a large-scale village, a waterway inhabiting around 4,000 people. This is a tight-knit community,
            where everyone has grown up going to school together, and families know families. The young people can often be found
            swimming together and hanging around the cove, practicing their diving and surfing, while the adults work either as
            fishermen, divers, wind sailors (for quick mail and trade), or boatsmen primarily.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="reso">
            <h3> Resources </h3>
            <p> Being a seaside cove, this town is best known for its water-related exports and technologies. The water in this
            specific area has qualities that are good for healing. In these waters are crystals that are used for decoration as well,
            as some glow and are thus used as lights. Diver's hunt the healing crystals and waters, wind-surfers use their knowledge of the wind's
            speed to travel quickly with mail. Boatsmen focus more on larger travel and deliveries, taking exported goods to other towns along the coast.
            Fishermen fish, this is the main provider of the Ray-Covian diet.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="land">
            <h3> Landscape </h3>
            <p> Ray Cove is less of a landscape and more of a seascape. Arching in a c-shape, this cove's residents reside on the water,
            just on the edge of the land. This way they can form the strongest bonds with one another as the water is central to all of them,
            and they can always see and connect with one another. Many use wind-surfurs to quickly deliver food, goods, and messages to one-another
            across the cove.</p>
