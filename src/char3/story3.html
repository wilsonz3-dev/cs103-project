                <h2>Population</h2>
                <p>Willow Rapids is a very diverse and accepting village, since many people have magical abilities from
                    the
                    river sap. No one is ever scared of abilities that come up, because they likely have one too. The
                    community helps each other a lot because of this, and is very strong through this bond. There aren’t
                    many people within the village, because people don’t really move in and people typically leave
                    because
                    there aren’t many career opportunities. However, the people who stay make the community what it is
                    and keep the traditions alive.</p>

            <div id="tree">
                <h2>Willow Tree and River</h2>
                <p>No one really knows where the Willow Tree came from, and why the sap has these magical properties.
                    However, everyone respects the tree and is grateful for the abilities it grants to everyone. As the
                    sap flows through the river, it allows for extremely fertile land, so harvests are always plentiful
                    and healthy. The communal properties of the river and tree build the foundation for the sense of
                    community many feel within Willow Rapids.

                <h2>The Sunday Mystic Market</h2>
                <p>Other than Kassandra as the oracle within the village, there are many others with magical abilities.
                    Every Sunday there is a market in the center of the village where people can showcase their
                    abilities, along with selling many mystical objects. There are potions and enchanted objects at the
                    market, and at the market ends with many performing with their abilities. Come down for a tour of
                    the market soon!
