                <h2>Backstory</h2>
                <p>Kassandra is from Willow Rapids, an isolated area in Fantasia that gets its energy and name from the
                    Willow Tree whose sap ferments the river that passes through the village. The sap from the Willow
                    Tree allows for many of its inhabitants to possess many extraordinary abilities, and Kassandra is
                    one of them. She can see into the future, often acting as the oracle in the village. Many are
                    intimidated by her, because whenever you go to see a fortune, she goes into a trace with smoke
                    coming out of her ears and mouth. However, once you get to know her, she is actually very fun and
                    bubbly, and loves having conversations with people that aren’t fortunes. She cares deeply about her
                    friends, and worries whenever she gets visions about them. But overall, Kassandra just wants the
                    best for Fantasia and everyone she cares about.

            <div id="relationships">
                <h2>Relationships</h2>
                <p>Kassandra lives with her parents in Willow Rapids, and she has two younger sisters who are twins, and
                    they have the ability to duplicate themselves, which causes trouble for the whole family. She knows
                    many people throughout Fantasia, through her being an oracle, however it makes some people wary of
                    her, and it is hard for her to make friends. However, one of her closest friends is Floradessa from
                    Misty Fields. Floradessa came for a fortune, but all Kassandra could see was them being friends, and
                    the rest is history. Give Kassandra a visit anytime, she’s always looking to know more people and
                    make more friends!
